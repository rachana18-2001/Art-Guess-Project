<b>Dataset Details:</b>
Total Categories: 123
Images per Category: 6000 (4920 for training, 1080 for testing)
Total Training Images: 606,360 (4920 images * 123 categories)
Total Testing Images: 132,840 (1080 images * 123 categories)

The Quick, Draw! Dataset has a collection of 50 Million drawings across 345 categories. This data is made available by Google, Inc. under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Google Creative Cloud: Quick, Draw! Dataset

For the Art Guess application, a subset of the Quick, Draw! dataset consisting of 123 categories of images was selected. Each category represents a different object or concept that users may be prompted to draw within the application. The dataset is stored in the .npy format, which is a binary format used for efficiently storing and loading large arrays of numerical data in Python
